\ Demonstrates use of FFI to communicate with external library.
\ In this case, we want to talk to 'ffilib.so' which we compiled.
\ You'll need to have something like LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. in order for Linux to
\ find it (DYLD_... on macOS)

\ First, declare the library:
"target/debug/rustsdrlib.dll" lib ffilib

ffilib "System could not load 'rustsdrlib.dll'" thrownull drop

"V" "sdrlib_run" func: runlib
"V" "sdrlib_close" func: closelib

runlib
10 sleep
closelib
bye
